        "sep= \"\" is a way to prevent Python being too clever when it's formatting your print statements.  Normally, Python tries to add spaces or newlines to your prints, even if you didn't ask for them.  As you can imagine this can be highly frustrating when you're trying to format some text the way YOU want it, not the way Python thinks you want it.  Use sep = \"\" to say the separator between chunks in a print statement should be nothing at all.  You can also use end=\"\" to supress new lines being added to the end of every print statement. \n",

The else statement however is NOT execute if you break out of a loop using the break statement."
