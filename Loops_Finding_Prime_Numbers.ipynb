        "sep= \"\" is a way to prevent Python being too clever when it's formatting your print statements.  Normally, Python tries to add spaces or newlines to your prints, even if you didn't ask for them.  As you can imagine this can be highly frustrating when you're trying to format some text the way YOU want it, not the way Python thinks you want it.  Use sep = \"\" to say the separator between chunks in a print statement should be nothing at all.  You can also use end=\"\" to supress new lines being added to the end of every print statement. \n",
        "  \n",
        "For both sep=\"\" and end=\"\" you aren't limited to just turning them on or off, you can put whatever you like between the speech marks and use that as your separator and endings.\n",

        "  \n",
        "Whilst you'll have seen if/else statements before, for/else is a bit of a weird one found nearly exclusively in Python.  When the for loop runs out of things to iterate over, it then drops into the else statement and iterates the code there.  The else statement however is NOT execute if you break out of a loop using the break statement."
