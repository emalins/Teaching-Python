Variables are great, variables store our "stuff".  But if we've a load of stuff, we'd need a load of variables, we'd need a variable for every single thing.
If we only used variables, we would need as many variables as we had bits of stuff.

What if we have a lot of stuff that's pretty much all the same?  
It'd be such a pain to curate hundreds of variables just to store a sequence of numbers where each might be bigger or smaller than the last.  
What if we needed to know what the 1,009th number was?  We'd need keep yet another variable to store the index of the other ones.

This is where lists come in.  

Lists provide a structure; a means to access the contents of a variable based on its position vs the position of all the other variables.
Need to know the 198th value?  No problem.  

Lists also give us an introduction to images.  Images are just a big list of colour values and their positions compared to each other.  
Images we'll cover soon, but master lists and you're already most of the way through images.
